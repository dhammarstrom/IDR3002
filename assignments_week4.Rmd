## The problem

Pre- to post-exercise trial may be analyzed in many different ways. This week we have looked at t-test of change-scores, ANCOVA with baseline correction and change scores as outcome and mixed effects models on raw scores.

This week you are expected to write a short report containing 

- Introduction: Using at least three references, describe the field of training volume and strength gains. State the objective of your study.
- Methods: Use the information you have about the study and write a short methods section about how the data (or how you think the data was collected). Write a **Statistics** section to describe how you analyzed the data.
- Results: The results should contain estimates of group differences, a figure to show trends over time and numbers used to draw inference (p-values or confidence intervals). Use mixed models or ANCOVA to estimate differences.
- Discussion: A short section where you interpret your results in relation to the studies you have presented in the introduction.

Use the strengtTests.csv data set. A more detailed description of the study can be found here:

You may do this assignment in groups of 3-4 students.

Good luck

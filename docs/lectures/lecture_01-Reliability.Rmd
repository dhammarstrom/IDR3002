# Background

* **Reliability** can be thought of as the ability to reproduce a measurement 
    - in the same individual 
    - on the same equipment with
    - the same operator
    
# Why is this interesting?

* When we want to say something about "responses" to training...
* We want to know about signal vs. noise

# Within-subject variation
* If an athlete is tested multiple times, the score/value in the test differs. 
* This variation depends on...

# Within-subject variation
* If an athlete is tested multiple times, the score/value in the test differs. 
* This variation depends on many potential variable factors
  - Biological
  - Psychological
  - Technical

# Some statistics!
* The standard deviation (SD) is the "average deviation from the average". How do we calculate it?

* Sum of deviations $=\sum{x_i-\bar{x}} = 0$. 

* Sum of the square deviations $=\sum{(x_i-\bar{x})^2}$ 

* Average square deviations = $\frac{\sum{(x_i-\bar{x})^2}}{n-1} = variance$

* The variance is the average squared deviation from the mean
* The standard deviation is the square root of the variance, thus on the same scale as the mean!

$$\sqrt{\frac{\sum{(x_i-\bar{x})^2}}{n-1}} = SD$$


# Within-subject variation
* If an athlete is tested multiple times, the score/value in the test differs.
* If we calculate the SD, this is the average deviation from the mean or the **typical error**
* Instead of using one athlete/subject, we can calculate the typical error from a study of two or more measurements on a group of subjects. 

# Typical error

* The typical error is a measure of random error (e.g. biological and technical variation).
* This variation is to be expected when performing two tests under similar circumstances

# Calculation of the typical error (TE)

* Two or more trials/tests are done in a control-group
* Change-scores are calculated (Trial2 - Trial1)
* The standard deviation of the change score is calculated (SD~change~)

$$TE = \frac{SD_{change}}{\sqrt{2}}$$

* Hopkins [@RN130], argues that $2\times TE$ is a suitable threshold when using TE as this increases the odds of a true change.

# Smallest worthwhile change (SWC)

* An alternative approach when no data on the error of measurement exists is to to use some clinically important threshold
* When this is not possible, we can instead estimate the smallest worthwhile effect (SWC).
* SWC is calculated as the $2\times SD_{between~subjects}$ where $SD_{between~subjects}$ is the estimate of the population standard deviation.
* This is an arbitrary threshold connected to the concept of effect sizes. 

# Internal validity
* Are we testing what we are suppose to?


# Improving reliability and internal validity

* Reproducability can be increased by controlling internal-validity, the degree to which we test what we are suppose to test [@RN1739]
* What factors can affect internal validity?

# Assignment

* We will perform two reliability studies:
  * Mid thigh pull test [@RN2271]
  * 1RM estimation from force-velocity curve [@RN2272]
* You are to plan and conduct a small reliability study.
* 5-10 participants tested twice.


# Assignment

The report includes:

* A discussions on estimation of reliability [@RN130].
* A short review of papers assessing reliability in the tested exercise (if there are any).
* Estimates of reliability and smallest worthwhile change.
* A detailed protocol written to maximize internal validity of the test [see @RN1739; @RN2271]

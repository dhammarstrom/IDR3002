## Content


- Defining replication and reproducibility
- Identifying challenges facing the data analyst in the sport sciences
- How to perform a reproducible data analysis - tools and workflow

## Replication
Replication is the degree to which scientific findings can be repeated using:

- independent data,
- independent research-groups, laboratories
- different methods, instrumentations...

[@RN1492]

## The replication crisis

Many scientific results are not possible to confirm. Ioannidis [-@RN1953] and others points out that scientific results most often are not true:

- Smaller studies are more likely to produce untrue conclusions
- Large amount of hypotheses produces large amount of false positives
- Low degree of scientific stringency produces more false claims
- E.g. financial interests increases the risk of false claims
- New fields more likely to produce false conclusions

## Reproducibility
- Reproducibility is the degree to which the same conclusions/interpretations can be made using a single dataset.
- A reproducible data analysis can be scrutinized on the level of the data, methods and documentation.
- This can be seen as a "minimum standard" in reporting a study when replication is not feasible [@RN1492].
- Reproducability is a way to bridge the gap between full replication to a non-replicable study [@RN1600]. 
- A reproducible study report is a well documented and explicit data-analysis.


## Why make data analysis explicit?

Before calculating a p-value (and making inference), most of the "scientific black-box activities" takes place.

## The data analysis pipeline -- A crucial part of every scientific project

- Not easy to fully implement...
- "From sample to data-point" descibed prior to data collection
- The goal is to make informed *a priori* decisions based on the question not a specific result (avoids bias [@RN1953]) 

## The data analysis pipeline

- Experimental design
- Data collection
- Raw data
- Tidy data
- Data cleaning
- Exploratory data analysis
- Statistical models
- Summary statistics
- Inference (p-values)

[@RN1955]

## Data collection

- Errors during data collection could be human and non-human errors
- Use data validation when entering data manually into a spreadsheet
- Avoid "black-box" data-capturing to avoid non-human errors


## Raw data

- Raw data is not processed, manipulated or transformed from other data. 
- This is however relative ... 
- In order to use raw data in an analysis, many processing steps may be needed

## Data cleaning

- Data cleaning can be performed on your *raw data* to make it more suitable for analysis. 
- Data cleaning is the process of formatting and sorting data into a suitable table-like format that is readable for you and your software.
- Data cleaning also identifies missing data or incorrectly entered data

## Data cleaning
```{r, echo=FALSE}
set.seed(1)
dat<-rnorm(10000, 140, 10)
dat[500]<-1400
```

- To identify e.g. problems in data collection (data entry or recording) we can use summary statistics
- A data set contains `r length(dat)` observations. We expect an average value around 140 units, the observed average is `r round(mean(dat), 2)`. The standard deviation is `r round(sd(dat), 2)`, the data is quite concentrated. However the maximum is `r round(max(dat), 2)`, this means we should be careful with making the assumption that the data is correct as this number is about 10 times the expected value.
- Graphical analysis of the data is useful as it summarises many aspects of the data

## Graphical method for identifying data problems

```{r, echo=FALSE}
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
plot(dat, ylab="Value", main="Plot of all data")
hist(dat[-500], main="Histogram of all correct data")
```

## The goal of data cleaning -> Tidy data

- Tidy data: each row is an **observation** and each column is a **variable** and each cell of the table contains **values**

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l | c | c | c | c }
Variable & Variable & Variable & Variable & Variable \\
\hline \hline
Value & Value & Value & Value & Value \\ 
Value & Value & Value & Value & Value\\
Value & Value & Value & Value & Value\\
Value & Value & Value & Value & Value 
\end{tabular}
\caption{Example of tidy data}
\end{table}

## Tidy data?

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l | c | c | c }
Participant & StrengthWeek1 & StrengthWeek2 & StrengthWeek3 \\
\hline \hline
FP1 & 120 & 125 & 140 \\ 
FP2 & 130 & 140 & 145 \\
FP3 & 140 & 145 & 130 \\
 
\end{tabular}
\caption{Example of tidy data?}
\end{table}

## Tidy data?

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l | c | c  }
Participant & time & strength \\
\hline \hline
FP1 & week1 & 120 \\
FP1 & week2 & 125 \\
FP1 & week3 & 140 \\
FP2 & week1 & 130 \\
FP2 & week2 & 140 \\
FP2 & week3 & 145 \\
FP3 & week1 & 140 
\end{tabular}
\caption{Example of tidy data?}
\end{table}

## Why aim for tidy data?

- Tidy data [@RN1956] builds upon a standard practice for organizing data
- Makes data exploration and analysis easier
- Standard for easy description and sharing of data
- Tidy data is the standard input in many statistical modeling routines in R, SPSS, SAS and STATA

## Exploratory data analysis

- When you have a data analysis plan, the purpose of the exploratory data analysis is to check assumptions about your data.
- Graphical methods is handy!
- Tidy data makes your exploratory analysis easy

## Exploratory data analysis

Checking assumptions using graphical methods

```{r, echo=FALSE}

d<-data.frame(subject=rep(c(paste("FP", seq(1:10))), 2), 
           time=c(rep("pre", 10), rep("post", 10)), 
           variable1=c(rnorm(10, 150, 10), rnorm(10, 135, 15)),
           variable2=c(rnorm(10, 2500, 150), rnorm(10, 2300, 150)))


par(mfrow=c(1,2))
hist(d$variable1, main="Histogram of Variable 1", xlab="Variable 1")
hist(d$variable2, main="Histogram of Variable 2", xlab="Variable 2")
```

## Exploratory data analysis

Checking assumptions using graphical methods, more information on one plot!

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.height = 2.5, fig.width = 5, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
p1<-ggplot(d, aes(variable1, variable2, color=time, label=subject, group=subject))+geom_line(color="black")+geom_point(size=5)

p1

```

## How to do explicit data analyses -- Prior to, or after data collection

Make a data analysis plan based on the goal of the study:

- Describe variables that are going to be collected, this is your **codebook**.
- Create specific data storage for grouped data variables (e.g. spreadsheets). 
- Describe how *raw-data* is transformed to *analytic data* (e.g. force-curves from isokinetic testing is converted to maximal torque).
- Describe how summary statistics are to be calculated
- Make *dummy-*tables and figures
- Describe what tests you need to draw inference

## Setting up an analysis workflow
Use a standard folder system that contains all data, analyses and reports. The whole project is contained in one *root folder*.

- Write a **codebook.txt** containing all variables in the dataset, how is data stored and accessed.
- **./data/**: contains all your data, e.g. spreadsheets with data from specific tests
- **./analysis/**: contains all analysis-files, e.g. SPSS-files that does analyses
- **./output/**: contains results from analyses, figures etc.

## Working with spreadsheets

- Spreadsheets are mainly suitable for data storage and entry.
- Making statistical analyses and or figures in spreadsheets is not adviced
- If you plan to make analyses in spreadsheets, store data in one sheet and make analyses and data manipulation in another spreadsheet.

[@RN1954]

## Guidelines for working with spreadsheets
- The goal is to make human- and computer-readable spreadsheets.
- Consistency, use the same variable names, coding etc for all data storage (e.g. *Male*, *Female*, *M*, *F* etc.)
- Good naming strategy, do not use spaces (e.g use *strength_week_1* instead of *Strength week 1*), avoid special characters (£, @, €).
- Write dates like YYYY-MM-DD
- Don't leave cells empty, don't comment if you have missing values, use a specific variable for comments
- Keep the data tidy, in a rectangle. 
- Do not use color, different fonts etc.
- Use data validation when entering data
- No summary statistics or calculations!
- Make a separate **codebook** (data dictionary)

[@RN1954]

## The **codebook**
- Variable names
- Explanation of the variable name, how was it recorded/collected
- Unit of measurement
- Expected values min-max 

## Why work with reproducible methods
- You may want to collaborate
- Your most frequent collaborator is yourselfe in the future
- Standard practices helps your collaborators (you!) to pick up where you left off

## Don't do the data analysis, tell the computer how to! Learn how to program!

- *Scripting* a data analysis will increase the potential for full reproducibility
- A sucessfull data analyst is **lazy**, tell the computer to do boring stuff!

## Don't do the data analysis, tell the computer how to! Learn how to program!

- Investing time in a programming language is investing in a generic skill
- The demand for data-analysis skills will likely increase (especially in sport science)

## What to learn if you want to be a better analyst/researcher

- [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) is a good place to start if you want do data analysis
- [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) has a large user community, easy to find help
- [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) is free, open source and users contribute with programs (this is not true for e.g. SPSS, SAS...)
- [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) is implemented in many graphical user-interface programs like [Jamovi](https://www.jamovi.org/)
- Using [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) with [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) makes a very productive analyst environment
- With [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) and resources like [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) you can write reports with based on your data. 
- Many statistical courses, books and resources use R
